# zenoh-c
C Client for zenoh

# Building
To build the **zenoh-c** client API you need to have installed [libuv](http://libuv.org) and ideally the [Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion) test framework. 

You also should define the environment variables LIB_UV_PATH LIB_CRITERION_PATH so that ${LIB_XXX_PATH}/include and ${LIB_XXX_PATH}/lib can be resolved.
